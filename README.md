# PSO-Kmeans-Clustering
This repository contains the implementation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for K-Means Clustering in Python.

# Overview
The Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is used to optimize the centroids of K-Means clustering. K-Means is a popular clustering algorithm that divides data points into 'K' clusters based on their similarity. PSO helps find the optimal centroids that minimize the sum of squared distances between data points and their assigned centroids.

# Data
The dataset includes education indicators in Indonesia like APK (Angka Partisipasi Kasar), APM (Angka Partisipasi Murni), and APM (Angka Partisipasi Murni) for primary to high school levels, sourced from BPS for the year 2021.
